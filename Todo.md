#TODO:
- Send messages between clients
- Render the messages sent by the client to each other
- Handle the special characters like delete and others that dont have unicode
- Add a better way to send the messages to the server other than using the "-send" command, use a button or something like that.
- Add multi-line message support, so the clients can send multi-line messages
